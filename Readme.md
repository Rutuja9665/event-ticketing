# üéüÔ∏è Event Ticketing on Clarity

## 1. Project Title
**Clarity Event Ticketing System**

## 2. Project Description
This project implements a simple, secure on-chain event ticketing system using the Clarity smart contract language on the Stacks blockchain. It uses Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent individual event tickets. The event organizer can mint tickets and transfer them to attendees.

## 3. Project Vision
The goal of this project is to build a transparent and tamper-proof ticketing platform that eliminates fraud, enables verifiable ownership of event tickets, and supports secure peer-to-peer transfers of tickets.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add a marketplace for reselling tickets
- Add metadata (like event name, seat number, etc.) to each ticket
- Enable refund and ticket invalidation by the organizer
- Implement KYC/attendee verification
- Integrate with a frontend app for event browsing and wallet connection
